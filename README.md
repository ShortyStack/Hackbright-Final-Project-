## **The Project** ##
---------------

The workday is finally over, and you're ready for some relaxing time at home with dinner and a movie. Allow Netflix and Chow to plan your evening! 

Once users create an account, choose a streaming source and enter their address, the magic will begin! Netflix and Chow will automagically choose a movie for you to enjoy and restaurant to order dinner from. Users will receive a unique combination consisting of a movie and a restaurant based on the entered location. 

This app also provides authorized account holders with administrative functions like managing users and viewing audit logs. Though we like to have fun, security is also a priority!  

Stop losing precious time deciding what to eat and watch. Sit back, relax and Netflix and Chow.

## **Favorite Challenges** ##


----------


Learning how to use an API was my favorite challenge. I never used an API before so I had to do extensive research which made the experience like a treasure hunt. Finally turning a JSON response into a Python dictionary that enabled me to pull out the specific information I was looking for was deeply satisfying. Coding truly feels like magic at times.
